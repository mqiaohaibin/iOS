1.Introduction
	1>About Memory Management
	2>At a Glance
	3>Good Practices Prevent Memory-Related Problems
	4>Use Analysis Tools to Debug Memory Problems

2.Memory Management Policy
	1>Basic Memory Management Rules
	  #A Simple Example
	  #Use autorelease to Send a Deferred release
	  #You Don't Own Objects Returned by Reference
	2>Implement dealloc to Relinquish Ownership of Objects
	3>Core Foundation Uses Similar but Different Rules

3.Practical Memory Management
	1>Use Accessor Methods to Make Memory Management Easier
	  #Use Accessor Methods to Set Property Values
	  #Don't Use Accessor Methods in Initializer Methods and dealloc
	2>Use Weak Reference to Avoid Retain Cycles
	3>Avoid Causing Deallocation of Objects You're Using
	4>Don't Use dealloc to Manage Scarce Resources
	5>Collections Own the Objects They Contain
	6>Ownership Policy Is Implemented Using Retain Counts
